    <h3>Interview is not complete</h3>
    <p>Right after inclusion Z-Way determines the functions and capabilities of the new device by sending a lot of requests to the very device. The message „Interview is not complete“ indicates that Z-Way did not receive all the information requested. There are multiple reasons for this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Z-Way is just too busy and needs more time. You should wait up to 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>The new device is battery operated and went into deep sleep mode too fast to complete the interview. Just wake up the battery-operated device following the instructions for manual wakeup in the devices manual. Usually this completes the interview.</li>
        <li>The device has a malfunction and can’t complete the interview. This must not happen for certified Z-wave devices but may sometimes happen for uncertified test and evaluation devices.</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>It is also possible that some wireless interference impacted the interview process. You can go to the <a href="#config/configuration/{{nodeId}}">“Interview” page </a> and review the process of the interview by clicking the button “Show Interview Results”. All incomplete command classes offer a button to re-do the interview for this command class only. Doing this sometimes helps to finish interview. It is also possible to re-do the whole interview process by hitting the button “Force re-Interview”.</p>
    <p><em>Note: If the reason for an incomplete interview is a failed secure command class you must re-include the device. The secure communication must be established within 10 seconds after inclusion.</em></p>
    
    <h3>Device Failed</h3>
    <p>Z-Way can’t connect to this device anymore. This means that the device is</p>
    <ul>
        <li>not powered: Repower it!</li>
        <li>moved to a position outside the wireless network coverage. Move the device back within the wireless range of the network.</li>
        <li>damaged.  Remove or Replace the device using the function in the <a href="#network/control">network management tab</a>.</li>
    </ul>
